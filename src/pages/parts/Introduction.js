          Attack on Titan (Shingeki no Kyojin) is a Japanese manga series
          created by Hajime Isayama. It was serialized in Kodansha's monthly
          Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine from September 2009 to April 2021. The story
          began with a simple premise set in a world where humanity was
          terrorized by giant humanoid beings, until the story gradually
          progresses to tackle very sensitive political and social themes like
          war, natalism, racism, cycle of hatred, psychological traumas, family,
          and child abuse. There are also some elements that reflect real,
          historical events so a great many of these issues really hit close to
          home.

          After the manga finale, many fans around the world voiced great
          disappointed and concern when such deep and relatable issues were not
          properly addressed. In the canon ending, these serious and complex
          themes, character development, and world building were forgotten or
          reduced to romance and some comedic scenes which goes against the
          established darker and more serious tone of the series. Hence the
          mission of AOTNOREQUIEM is to give those who were unsatisfied with the
          ending, who grew up with with series and held it close to their hearts
          a proper closure and also a fitting and satisfactory conclusion to
          what we all believed was a modern masterpiece.

          AOT no Requiem will explore an alternate ending that is the opposite
          of the canon one. It is a rewrite of the last three chapters of Attack
          on titan (137, 138, 139) and combined into ONE long chapter updated
          into parts. It will still follow the events of the previous chapters,
          so please continue to support Attack on Titan’s official release.
          Thank you.
